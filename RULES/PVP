⚠️
1. BOMB ARE TOTALLY PROHIBITED IN ALL CASES.

BOMBS (Pipe bomb/molotovs/smoke bombs/chemical bombs),
NOISETRAPS (Any kind of trap that makes noises to atract zeds),

It is prohibited to craft / own them in any way, doesn't matter if you are a cop, military, bandit, etc... you can not have them.

If we know that you have a bomb / used a bomb you will be punished. (smoke bombs still can be used but avoid griefing)

⚠️
 
2. PVP MUST BE DONE VALUING LIFE AND MUST BE FAIR.

If you see other player with PVP ON you're NOT free to kill him on sight.

For attacking them both players must have their PVP ON and should at least advise that they want fight, it must keep fair. (you can not just tell him I'm going to kill you and shoot him right away, you must wait him to get ready and get his PVP enabled, if his pvp does not get enabled you can not kill him) 

Otherwise if you are the one with PVP ON, you can only kill players that have PVP ON + AGREE / PLAYERS THAT ATTACK YOU

(THE BEST YOU CAN DO IS NOT TO RUN WITH PVP ON AS PLAYERS WILL MAY BE SCARED AND YOU AND SHOOT FIRST AND LATER ASK, it does not make sense to have your pvp on if you don't want to make a mess.)

⚠️
 
3. YOU MUST RESPECT GOVERNMENT FACTIONS.

Event they are not a giant army IRL they would still be more, more prepared and with better supplies, doesn't make sense to start fights against police/army because they outnumber you. 

If you feel government factions are not behaving as they should feel free to open a ticket and tell us more about the problem.
